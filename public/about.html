<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a student of Udemy Web Development course 2023 with Dr. Angela Yu. My
  goal is to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReAct by the summer. I also want to
  continue to build on that knowledge and eventually learn a programming
  language. I want to learn how applications and computer programs are made.

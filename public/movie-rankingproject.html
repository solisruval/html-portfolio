<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blade Runner: The Final Cut</h3>
<p>The visuals and soundtrack really draw you into this seemingly simple but profound and thought-provoking story.</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>In space, no one can hear you scream. Indeed. Another Ridley Scott Masterpiece.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad</h3>
<p>In particular, the Headless Horseman adaptation always spooked me as a kid and still does to this day.</p>
